Simple python mattermost bot that listens to specific commands and will have incoming webhook support.
Hard-forked and refactored from [mmpy_bot](https://github.com/attzonko/mmpy_bot), and relies heavily on [mattermostdriver](https://github.com/Vaelor/python-mattermost-driver).

Supports both multi-threading and `asyncio` execution.

Work in progress, but can already be used. See `bot.py` and `plugins/default.py` for examples of how to run a bot and add custom functionality. For an overview of planned features, have a look at [the roadmap](https://github.com/jneeven/snaketalk/projects/1).
